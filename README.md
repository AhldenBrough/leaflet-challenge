# leaflet-challenge

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>In this challenge, we were tasked with creating an interactive map visualization of recent earthquakes around the globe. Using data from usgs.gov, all earthquakes from the past week are plotted on a leaflet map. The markers vary based on magnitude of the earthquake (marker size) and depth of the earthquake(marker color)</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<p>In the top right corner of the map there is a layer control where you can select the options below</p>
<ul>
  <li>Street Map: A street view of the globe from OpenMap</li>
  <li>Topographic map: A topographic view of the globe from OpenMap</li>
  <li>Carto DB positron: An alternate streetview in light mode from Carto DB</li>
  <li>Carto DB darkmatter:An alternate streetview in dark mode from Carto DB</li>
  <li>Quakes: Toggle the earthquake markers on and off</li>
  <li>Tectonic Plates: View an overlay of tectonic plates, can be toggled on and off</li>
</ul>
